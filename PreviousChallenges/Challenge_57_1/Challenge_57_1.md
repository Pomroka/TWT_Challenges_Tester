# Challenge 57.1: Square

The longest diagonals of a square matrix are defined as follows:

- the first longest diagonal goes from the top left corner to the bottom right one.
- the second longest diagonal goes from the top right corner to the bottom left one.

Given a square matrix, your task is to swap its longest diagonals by exchanging their elements at the corresponding positions.

You are given number `T`. For each test case you are given a number `n`. `n` lines follow defining the matrix.

## Example

### Input
```
1
3
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
```

### Output
```
3 2 1
4 5 6
9 8 7
```

## Submission and Grading 

- code must be written in python
- `eval` and `exec` functions are not allowed same goes for `import`
