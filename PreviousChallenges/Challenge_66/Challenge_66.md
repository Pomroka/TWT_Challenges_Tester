# Challenge 66: The apocalypse | Tim & Alex apocalypse #2

Tim: "Alex. Alex!"

Alex: "huh?"

Tim: "We need to get out of here, now."

Tim points at the tv. Alex looks up, waken up from his puzzle solving trance, the tv shows a view from a camera lying sideways on the ground. People are coughing, barely standing on their feet, some are lying on the ground with no life left in their eyes. The color drains from Alex's face. Tim dials his parents. No response. He dials the number of every single staff member at their addresses. No response. Alex suddenly grabs Tim by the arm, and almost makes him fall over as he drags him out to a parking lot where they have a car parked. Tim comes to his senses and runs with Alex to the car.

Alex puts the car in drive and floors the gas heading for a grocery shop. During the drive Tim spots a billboard with something about Hiroshima written on it. "Weird" he thinks, "this apocalypse, and now Hiroshima." When they get to the shop they see a lock on the entrance with a screen and a keypad. This is what the lock reads:
