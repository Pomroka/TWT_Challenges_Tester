# Challenge 70: The end | Tim & Alex apocalypse #6

Tim is in the kitchen, a knife in his right hand. He slowly urges one foot forward, then the other. His knees are shaking so hard he is barely able to control them. His hands are becoming slippery from sweat, he grips the knife tighter. Every muscle in his body is tense, his head is swinging, he has to remind himself to breathe every second. Alex is just a few feet away from him. One… Two steps forward, Tim raises the knife, and moves it down as hard as he can. Alex feels a sudden whistle, launches himself right, spins around, grabs the hand with the knife with his right hand, and almost lands a fatal kick. He realizes he is facing Tim and pulls his kick before it does any damage.

Alex: “Shit!”

Tim shudders, and crashes on the floor. Alex sits beside him, takes the knife and sets it aside.

Alex: “I believe we can figure out a way to get through this.”

Tim: “How… The world is dead... It’s a miracle we’re even still alive, we’ll probably be dead as well before we know it.”

Alex: “Exactly, most people are dead, however that doesn’t mean their DNA is gone. If we can find the right equipment we can start artificially reproducing humans. As disgusting as it sounds, at least to me, I think it’s a possible option. We also need to either do it fast or wait out until the disease stops its rampage.”

Tim: “I guess we can do that as long as we have food.”

Alex: “Right, now if you don’t mind I’ll go get some air.”

Alex stands up and walks off towards the house’s backyard. Tim ponders on something then looks in the direction Alex walked off to. He doesn’t see him. Tim stands up, walks up to the backyard and sees Alex laying face down in the grass. He rushes to him, turns him over, and sees him crying.

Tim: “We’ve gotta stop scaring each other”

Alex lets out a laugh.

Alex: “Definitely”

Tim: “I like your idea let’s get onto it”

Alex: “Yeah”

A few years later Tim and Alex find a machine that could help them in their quest. The machine seems somewhat complicated and outputs what seems like a nonsensical string of characters. Our two apocalypse survivors figure out the nonsensical string is actually some message encoded with Base64. Help them write up something that will decode it for them.

## Task

You are given a number `T` the number of tests cases. `T` cases follow. For each case you are given a Base64 string, decode it.

## Examples

### Input
```
2
aGk=
Ynll
```

### Output
```
hi
bye
```
