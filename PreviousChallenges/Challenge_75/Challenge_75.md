Alex: "What now :PepeBruh:"  
Avob: "S.. Sylte i is dddead."  
Espiobest: "I thought you went off with him? ðŸ¤¨"  
Avob: "I did... but I turned around for one sec, then looked back and there he was... stabbed"  
infernus: "Maybe this time we should go in groups of three. If one person doesn't spot the murderer, maybe the other can."
