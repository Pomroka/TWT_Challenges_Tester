# Challenge 86: Tic-tac-toe... with numbers

Let's solve a tic-tac-toe problem

## Task

You are given a number `n` and `n` testcases follow for each testcase, you are given a starting player `X` or `O` and then you are given the moves made between `X` and `O` alternatively

So if the moves are `12569` and `X` starts,

```sh
1 - X
2 - O
5 - X
6 - O
9 - X
```

You have to output the winner(`X` or `O`) if there is any otherwise output `Tie`

The positions on the board are as follows

```sh
1 | 2 | 3
---------
4 | 5 | 6
---------
7 | 8 | 9
```

## Example

### Input

```sh
2
X
1, 2, 5, 6, 9
X
1, 3, 2, 4, 6, 9, 7, 5, 8
```

### Output
