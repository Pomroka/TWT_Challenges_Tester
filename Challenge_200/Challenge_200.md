**Difficulty: 1/10  
Labels: Reverse**

Can you believe it's already challenge #200? Thank you all so much for continue doing the challenges with us.
As per usual, we would like to revisit some old problems written by the original problem writers for the weekly challenges. However, you will not be given any instructions. Instead, you have to figure out the task on your own from the examples.

## Task

You are given a number `T` and `T` test cases follow, for each test case:

- The only line contains two strings, each of exactly two characters, separated by a single space.

Output either `-1`, `0`, `1`, or `2`, the answer.

### Examples

#### Input

```rust
14
a2 a2
a1 h8
a1 h7
e6 b3
e7 f5
h1 a5
h1 a8
g5 b6
g7 h6
e2 e4
b1 g8
e1 e6
e1 d8
e5 e5
```

#### Output

```rust
0
1
-1
1
-1
-1
1
2
1
2
2
-1
