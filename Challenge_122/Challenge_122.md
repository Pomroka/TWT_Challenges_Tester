# Challenge 122: Calm Down!

**Difficulty: 1/10**  
**Labels: Control Flow**

You are developing a chat application. During the beta testing phase, you are noticing a lot of people spamming in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS LIKE THIS, which may be negative for the community. You would like to convert those to lower cases.

## Task

You are given a number `T` and `T` test cases follow, for each test case:

- The first line contains an integer `N`.
- The second line contains `N` words, each consisting of only English alphabets (`a-zA-Z`), separated with a single space.

Output the words, separated by a single space, after the following filtration:

- If a word is the **first** word in the list, leave it as it is.
- If a word is **not the first** word and all of its letters are capital letters (`A-Z`), then make the entire word lowercase.
