# Challenge 201: Bit-reversed Integers

**Difficulty: 2/10  
Labels: Binary, Strings**

Let `f(n)` denote the bit-reversed 8-bit binary number of `n`. This sequence is found in computer programs that need to reverse the bits in a byte, typically during data compression or other bit-level encoding. `f(n)` is computed by taking the 8-bit binary representation of the base 10 integer `n`, reversing the eight digits, and then converting it back to base 10 representation.
For example, `f(29) = 184` because `29=00011101` would turn into `10111000=184`.

## Task

You are given a number `T` and `T` test cases follow, for each test case:

- The only line contains an integer `n`.

Output a single integer, the base-10 representation of `f(n)`, the bit-reversed 8-bit binary number of `n`.

### Examples
