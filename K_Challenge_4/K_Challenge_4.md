# K_Challenge 4

It is finally here after a long time.

And it is a geometry one

## Where's the center?

Given the `n` points of a `n` sided regular polygon, find its center.
The center of a regular polygon will be the point equidistant from every point of the polygon.

If the coordinates has too many decimal places, print only two after the point

5.127 = 5.12  
5.1 = 5.1  
5.12 = 5.12  

## Input:

You are given an integer `n` and `n` testcases follow.
```
2
100,100 200,100 200,200 100,200
200,300 400,300 400,500 200,500
```

## Output:
```
150,150
100,400
```
