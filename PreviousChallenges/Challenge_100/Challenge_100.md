# Challenge 100: Looking Back

**Difficulty: ???/10**  
*Hooray! It's **Challenge #100!*** Thank you for doing the challenges with us.
It feels refreshing to go back and look at the old challenges, they bring up a lot of memories, especially when 2 years ago, some of the active members and I just learned Python, we were trying to solve Alex's and Infernus' weekly challenges together. It was fun!

For this challenge, the task will be **hidden**. You will need to guess/infer the task from the examples, or use hints which are available just inside this message.

## Task

You are given a number `T` and `T` testcases follow, for each testcase,
You are given a number `N`. Output the correct answer as inferred from examples below or as described in hints found in this message.  
There is **only one** correct output for each input.

### Examples

#### Input

```rs
4
378
4783
100
98765
```

#### Output

```rs
4
48
1
988
```

#### Note

`1 ≤ T`
`1 ≤ N ≤ 100,100,100`
