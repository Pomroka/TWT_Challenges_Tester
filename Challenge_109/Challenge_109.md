# Challenge 109: Days Between, Part I

**Difficulty: 3/10**  
Given two dates (month and date, no year), calculate the number of months and the number of days between them.

## Task

You are given a number `T` and `T` testcases follow, for each testcase:  
You are given two dates, `A` and `B`, in ISO-like format of `mm-dd`, separated by a single space.
If `B` is `M` months and `D` days after `A`, output `M D`.
Assume February has `28` days, and other months follow normal international rules.

### Examples

#### Input

```rs
7
02-02 02-03
11-11 12-11
09-11 12-03
02-27 03-31
04-11 06-10
07-07 07-07
01-01 12-31
```

#### Output

```rs
0 1
1 0
2 22
1 4
1 30
0 0
11 30
```

For test case 1, **Feb. 3rd** is `0` months, `1` day after **Feb. 2nd**.
For test case 2, **Dec. 11th** is `1` month, `0` days after **Nov. 11th**.
For test case 7, Almost a full year, but one day short, so `11` months `30` days.

You can use this tool to find solution of any data for testing purposes (just leave the year field blank): [www.timeanddate.com](https://www.timeanddate.com/date/durationresult.html)

#### Note

- `1 <= T`
- Date `A` will always come before date `B`, or is the same as date `B`.
- All date will be in `mm-dd` format.
- Zero padding will be added for single-digit numbers.
- `01 <= mm <= 12` and `01 <= dd <= 31`.
- All dates will be valid (nothing like `02-30`).
