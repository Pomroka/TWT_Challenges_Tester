# Challenge 80: poly uhhh, poly-hour

It is not often that a story really takes me a while to write, but this one did, here ya go https://bit.ly/3qH3gEq ~~cuz I totally wrote it~~

## Task:

You are given a number `T` and `T` testcases follow. For each testcase, you are given two lists of `x,y` coordinates that can be connected to form a polygon.
If a collision occurs between the two polygons output `true`, otherwise output `false`.

## Example:

### Input:
```
3
3
200,100 250,250 160,210
200,10 250,190 160,210
3
100,300 200,400 200,200
400,400 300,300 400,100
4
100,100 200,100 200,200 100,200
150,100 200,150 200,200 100,300
