# Challenge 83: Pig Latin

You have two friends who are speaking Pig Latin to each other! Pig Latin is the same words in the same order except that you take the first letter of each word and put it on the end, then you add `'ay'` to the end of that. (`"road" = "oadray"`) 

## Task

You are given a number `T` and `T` testcases follow, for each testcase sentence and turn it into the same sentence in Pig Latin! 

## Example

### Input 

```
3
nevermind youve got them
hi hows it going
i have a cow
```

### Output 

```
evermindnay ouveyay otgay hemtay
ihay owshay tiay oinggay
iay avehay aay owcay
```

## Note

There is no capitalization or punctuation of any kind.
If a word has only one letter you only need to add `"ay"` to the end of it.
