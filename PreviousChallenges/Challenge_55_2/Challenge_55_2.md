# Challenge 55.2: Lines

You failed your last math exam. Yes you did! Your math teacher decided to give you 10 assignments of homework everyday until you don't make any mistakes and you don't have enough time to solve them so as a pro programmer you will make a program to solve your homework for you. 

You have two equations of the first degree `ax + by = c`. You should find how many points do those two lines intersect. If they intersect at infinite number of points print `-1`

On First line, you are given an integer `T` the number of test cases. `T` test cases follow. Each test case has `two` lines. On each line you are given `a`, `b` and `c` in the following format `a b c`. You should output `one` number of how many points do the two lines intersect.

## Examples

### Input 
```
1
1 2 3
1 2 4
```

### Output 
```
0
```

## Submissions and Grading 

- code must be written in python
- `eval` and `exec` functions are not allowed same goes for `import`
