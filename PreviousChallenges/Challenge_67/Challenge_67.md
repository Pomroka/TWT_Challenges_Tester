# Challenge 67: The end, a new beginning | Tim & Alex apocalypse #3

Alex almost figured out the answer when he hears a window smashing, he looks up. Tim throws away a branch and climbs through a broken window. Alex looks behind and sees what seems like a swarm of people heading towards the shop. He curses and runs after Tim.

Alex: "What are we getting?"

Tim: "As much canned foods as we can, and any other food we can fit in the car."

Alex: “So where do we go?”

Tim: “Office”

Alex: “But-”

Tim: “I know what I said, but do you have any idea where to go besides the office?”

Alex: “No”

Tim: “Neither do I”

They pack everything they can before the swarm and head back to the office. After unpacking with Alex, Tim sits down on a couch and turns on a tv. He gets a view from a camera on a helicopter flying over the city. People can be seen lying on the ground near the hospital and up to several blocks out as well. “It’s as if the disease is picking up its pace,” Tim thinks.

Alex’s thoughts take a different turn: “The disease is becoming more fierce, we really need to move out somewhere safer to have a chance at surviving this.” He goes on his computer and starts furiously typing up search requests. A popular search pops up about running a 100 meters, Alex dismisses it. A moment later he finds what he thinks is the perfect place. There’s only one caveat to it… To be allowed in, you need figure out the real mac address out of several given to you.

## Task

You are given a number `T` the number of tests cases. `T` cases follow.
 For each case you are given multiple mac addresses. Print back the real mac address out of the list.
(a mac address is a group of six pairs of hexadecimal digits)
