# Challenge 65: The beginning of the end | Tim & Alex apocalypse #1

Alex's brain is firing on all cylinders trying to come up with a solution to a puzzle Tim gave him. Tim chose hex color values (for example `0xFFFF00`), Alex needs to figure out what color can be added to them to make them white (in this case `0x0000FF`).

Help Alex figure out the puzzle before his brain bursts. 

In the mean time, an announcer on a tv in the distance says: "In other news, the Saint Paul Hospital has just received a person with an illness no doctor in the vicinity can identify. Doctor Paul, what does the illness look like?" "The guy had *cough* rashes in some places. *cough* He said he had *cough* trouble keeping his balance." "Well then isn't that creepy? Moving on, a tiger has..." 

As Tim was listening to it, he found it odd that a doctor would be coughing on the job. Alex was too busy trying to solve the puzzle.

## Task

You are given a number `T` the number of tests cases. `T` cases follow.
For each case there is a `hex color value`, figure out what color needs to be added to it to make it `white`.

### Input:
```

### Output:
```
0x0000FF
