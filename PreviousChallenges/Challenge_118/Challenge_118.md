# Challenge 118: Time Conversion

**Difficulty: 2/10**  
SnowballSH is terrible at time management, so his friend wanted to write him a clock. However, he is having issues converting seconds to hours. Can you help him?

## Task

You are given a number `T` and `T` test cases follow, for each test case:

- You are given an integer `S`.

Let `S` seconds be equivalent to `H` hours, `M` minutes, `S` seconds such that `0 <= M, S < 60` (aka in the simplest form), output `H M S`.

### Examples

#### Input

```rust
4
50
100
3661
7200
```

#### Output

```rust
0 0 50
0 1 40
1 1 1
2 0 0
```

### Note

`1 <= T`
`0 <= S <= 10`<sup>`16`</sup>

### Submissions

Code can be written in any of these languages:

- `Python` 3.10
- `C/C++` (GCC 10.3)
- `Ruby` 3.1
- `Golang` 1.18
