# Challenge 56.2: Shoes

Yesterday you found some shoes in the back of your closet. Each shoe is described by two values:

- `type` indicates if it's a left or a right shoe (`0` for left, `1` for right)
- `size` is the size of the shoe.

## Task

Check whether it is possible to pair the shoes you found in such a way that each pair consists of a right and a left shoe of an equal size.

You are given number `T`. For each test case you are given a number `n`. `n` lines follow. Each line contains two values: the `type` of the shoe (`0` or `1`) and its `size`.

## Example
