# Challenge 71: A chess interruption | Amogus #1

A blade moves, a cry is suppressed, blood is spilling out on the floor. A week earlier the staff team had decided to try out travelling across the stars. They bought a spaceship, packed the necessary resources and blasted off into space. Espiobest and takos are playing chess in the ship lobby. Espiobest hears a what seems to him like a muffled cry.

Espiobest: "Did you hear that?"

takos: "Hear what?"

Espiobest: "Nevermind"

Espiobest stands up and heads over to check out what he thinks he heard.

takos: "Where are you going? We haven't finished yet"

Espiobest: "Just a sec."

Takos is lazy when playing chess so he lets a little program calculate possible chess moves for him. However he just realized he forgot to include bishop moves into the program. Can you help takos out with that?

Espiobest turns a corner, looks down at the floor, and runs to the bathroom to throw up.
