# Challenge 69: Hit the road Jack! | Tim & Alex apocalypse #5

The wind is whistling, the monotone sound of tires rolling on the asphalt can be faintly heard from inside the car. Having figured out the secrets of Redwood Grove Tim and Alex have packed up and hit the road. A light in the distance turns red, Alex instinctively releases the gas pedal.

Tim: “Why are we slowing down?”

Alex: “There’s a stop sign ahead”

Tim: “We’re in a literal apocalypse, there’s no cops who will chase you for running a red light and no other cars to run into at an intersection”

Alex: “Yeah, you got a point”

Alex steps on the gas pedal again. 

They drive into the village, figure out which house they both like the most, and unpack. Alex goes on the internet, or what’s left of it. Searches up how to grow all the produce they bought. During his search he finds out mushrooms are lively little bastards.

Tim’s thoughts are swinging: “If this really is an apocalypse, that means everyone dies. But if everyone dies then humanity as a whole can’t live on? All my work gone to nothing… Is there any point to all this? Am I going mad? It’s possible. Should I just... end it all?”

## Task

I have honestly no idea how to tie the story to a challenge at this point so here's a random challenge for ya'll.

You are given a number `T` the number of tests cases. `T` cases follow.
For each case you are given a `2` dimensional array of numbers. Print out how many different `2x2` squares you can make using this given matrix.

## Examples

### Input
```
2
5 3
1 2 1
2 2 2
2 2 2
1 2 3
2 2 1
2 4
2 2 2 2
2 2 2 2
```

### Output
```
6
1
```

### Explanation

In the first case you can have these squares:
```
1 2   2 1   2 2   2 3   2 2   2 2
2 2   2 2   2 2   2 1   1 2   2 3
```
that's 6 of them total.

In the second case, there's only one possible square that can be made:
```
2 2
2 2
```
