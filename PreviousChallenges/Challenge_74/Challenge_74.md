# Challenge 74: Tekgar's sus | Amogus #4

Tekgar: “Heyyy, sorry I’m late. Had a long way to go, and needed to go throw away some trash.”  
Takos: “Btw, are we gonna finish the chess game?”  
Espiobest: “We have more important matters to solve right now.”  
Takos: “Alright”  
Espiobest: “Currently Tekgar is the most suspicious one.”  
Tekgar: “Suspicious? What are we talking about?”
Avob: “Tekgar seems to be oblivious to the situation at hand.”  
Tekgar: “Of course I am, I come to the meeting, Espio starts accusing me of being suspicious, and I don’t even know what happened.”  
Espiobest: “That’s exactly what the killer would say…”  
Tekgar: “K… Killer?”  
Espiobest: “You should know.”  
Alex: “Lynx was presumably murdered.”  
Tekgar: “Lynx?!”  
Alex: “Yeah”  
Avob: “Hey guys, I got a plan. Let’s go back to doing what we were doing, if anyone seems sus, immediately call a meeting.”  
Sylte: “Everyone should also have one other person with them.”  
Avob: “Yes, great idea.”

Everyone in a chorus except Avob and Sylte: “Sounds good”  
SpongeBoi goes on to making a little algorithm needed for a program he’s making, the description of that is provided below.

## Task

You are given a number `T` the number of tests cases. `T` cases follow.  
For each case you are given a list of numbers separated by spaces. Given that each number in the list has its own index, and the number specifies the amount of indexes to go forward if it’s positive or backwards if the number is negative, print `True` if starting at any number in the list you can cycle through each number exactly one time and come back to the starting index. Print `False` otherwise.

## Examples

### Input
```
2
2 3 1 -4 -4 2
5 7 -2 -4 -7 4 -2
```

### Output
```
True
False
```
