# Challenge 68: New place | Tim & Alex apocalypse #4

Flying over the clouds, Tim spots a mountain in the distance and heads toward it to find- Tim jumps as he feels a tap on his shoulder that wakes him up from his daydream.

Alex: “Sorry, didn’t mean to scare you”

Tim: “No worries, what’s up”

Alex: “I’ve been searching for a place to settle before it’s all over and I found this village called ‘Redwood Grove’ in the suburbs of Silicon Valley, it looks promising.”

Tim: “Good thinking, but umm... Do you think the situation is truly so dire that we would need to move away, I mean how bad is th-” Tim chokes on his words as an announcer on the tv says “over 50 cities have now reported the presence of the deadly disease. This is getting really serious really fast, remember to stay at home, ration your food and water and don’t let anyone in or out.”

Tim: “Ok, maybe we should move out. Let’s see what’s the place you found. Hmm, it looks like everything related to the place is encoded somehow… Oh, run length encoding of course.”

Alex: “Right, one sec I’ll make something up so we don’t have to decode it as we read it.”
